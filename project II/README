Project Design:
	For part I, the implementation follows the guide of algorithm described in the ACM TOIS 2003 "QProber: A System for Automatic Classification of Hidden-Web Databases" paper. The core part of this algorithm is the recursive function called 
	classify. It takes a root category, a database url, a threashold coverage, a threashold specificity and a parent node 
	specificity as input and outputs the target classification result. Note that the coverage and specificity is just a kind of approximation, which utilizes the method described in the paper, too.
